# DeepSeek-R1-AI-Voice-Agent 

This project enables real-time speech-to-text transcription using **AssemblyAI**, generates AI responses with **DeepSeek R1 (7B model) via Ollama**, and converts text responses into speech using **ElevenLabs**. The entire process happens in real-time, allowing for seamless interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions  

### Step 1: Sign Up & Install Dependencies  

#### ‚úÖ Get API Keys  
- **AssemblyAI (for speech-to-text):** [Sign up for a free API key](https://www.assemblyai.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yt_smit_28)  
- **ElevenLabs (for text-to-speech):** [Sign up for an account](https://elevenlabs.io/)  

#### ‚úÖ Install Ollama  
DeepSeek R1 is accessed via Ollama. Install Ollama from:  
üîó **[Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**  

#### ‚úÖ Install PortAudio (Required for real-time transcription)  
- **Debian/Ubuntu:**  
  ```bash
  apt install portaudio19-dev

  MacOS:
brew install portaudio
‚úÖ Install Python Libraries

Before running the script, install the required dependencies:

pip install "assemblyai[extras]"
pip install ollama
pip install elevenlabs
‚úÖ (MacOS Only) Install MPV for Audio Streaming

brew install mpv
Step 2: Download the DeepSeek R1 Model
Since this script uses DeepSeek R1 via Ollama, download the model locally by running:

ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b
Step 3: Real-Time Transcription with AssemblyAI
The script captures real-time audio from your microphone and converts speech to text using AssemblyAI.
This transcription is then sent to the AI model for processing.

Step 4: AI Response with DeepSeek R1
Once a transcript is generated, it is sent to DeepSeek R1 (7B model) via Ollama.
The model generates a response, which is then converted into speech using ElevenLabs.

Step 5: Live Audio Streaming
The AI-generated response is streamed back to the user in real-time as speech, using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech engine.

üéØ Running the Script

Once all dependencies are installed and the model is downloaded, simply run:

python main.py
